            - Social Media Page (integrating in instagram? that would be cool)
            - Photo Album (various life photos that I like, and maybe add a caption to them? I could section
              it off by year, and just have links to each year near the top of the page. That would be cool)
            - Misc Art Page (just a place to dump drawings, knitting projects, other random junk i want to

            include social media links (instagram, snapchat, facebook, linkedin), and contact information.

                <h1>Hello! My name is Hagen Zhang,</h1>
                <h4>and here's what that means to me:</h4> 
                <br>
                <p class="body_text">
                I was born in May of 2002, and grew up in the California Bay Area. My parents are both Chinese, and 
                I have one older brother who is 8 years older than me. I go by he/him pronouns.
                <br><br>
                I'm a student at Northeastern Univserity, studying for a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in 
                Software Development. 
                <br>
                My current plan is to graduate in 2024, which is coming up a lot sooner than I admittedly feel ready for!
                <br><br>
                Alongside with being a programmer, I'm also very into music and the outdoors!<br>
                I'm a mostly self-taught musician, and my primary instrument at the moment is the electric guitar &#40;although
                I also do know how to play drums, bass, and a tiny bit of piano&#41;
                <br><br>
                I took piano lessons and studied classical music for a few years in elementary school, but then decided to drop 
                it in favor of learning how to play the drum kit. I had an amazing drum teacher who taught me for 5 years and 
                helped me find meaning and genuine enjoyment in music making, rather than just playing the notes on a sheet of 
                paper.
                <br><br>
                I played drums for various church worship teams until my third year of highschool, when I decided to also pick 
                up the guitar since there was a lack of guitarists at my home church. I eventually fell in love with the instrument, 
                and now I treat the guitar as my primary instrument! Wild how life works out.
                <br><br>
                My love for the outdoors stems from my background in the Boy Scouts. I was a part of Troop 485 for 4 years, and 
                during that time I had the privilege of being able to experience campouts, hikes, and backpacking trips on a monthly
                basis. I've completed High Adventures like Northern Tier and Sea Base, and also had the chance to server as a the
                Troop Leader &#40;also known as the SPL&#41; for a term.
